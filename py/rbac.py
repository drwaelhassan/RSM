Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Secrecy Model Implementation
Author: Wael Hassan

This module demonstrates an implementation of the RBAC secrecy model in Python. It includes basic entities such as User, Role, Permission, Operation, and Object, defines relationships between these entities, and implements secrecy policies to control access based on these relationships.
